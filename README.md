# Vaccine Scheduler Application

I created this application in March 2024 using SQL and Java languages to simulate a vaccine scheduling program. Users can log in and make a vaccine appointment. They can choose a caregiver and vaccine they want during their appointment. Some additional functionalities include cancelling an appointment and viewing caregiver/patient schedules. Appointment schedules and available vaccines and caregivers are stored in tables through SQL. Queries are pulled from SQL through Java to fulfill user requests.
